- Compatible with the **AXI 1-wire host driver for AMD programmable logic IP core** Linux driver.

## Functional Description

The AXI 1-Wire Host provides a 1-Wire bus controller interface to an AXI4-Lite interface. The AXI 1-Wire supports the 1-Wire bus protocol with the essential 1-Wire bus master signals being supported. The AXI 1-Wire Host contains a 1-Wire Host Core Controller, which guarantees protocol timing for driving off-board devices. It can be configured to generate an interrupt when the controller completes the signal instruction cycle. The AXI 1-Wire Host can be configured to bypass the 1-Wire Host Core Controller to manipulate the 1-Wire bus as a general purpose I/O (GPIO). The AXI 1-Wire Host primary components are the AXI4-Lite interface, the 1-Wire Host Core Controller, the interrupt controller, and the GPIO module.

### AXI4-Lite Interface

The AXI4-Lite Interface module implements a 32-bit AXI4-Lite slave interface for accessing 1-Wire Host and GPIO registers. For additional details about the AXI4-Lite slave interface, see the specification usage section of the *AXI4-Lite IPIF LogiCORE IP Product Guide* [(PG155)](https://docs.amd.com/access/sources/ud/document?isLatest=true&url=pg155-axi-lite-ipif&ft:locale=en-US).

### 1-Wire Host Core Controller

The 1-Wire Host Core Controller implements hardware to guarantees 1-Wire protocol timing to drive off-board devices. It is controlled by an external processor to generate and report the 1-Wire bus master signals. It supports the following five instructions:

- Reset/Presence
- Write bit (0 or 1)
- Read bit (0 or 1)
- Write byte
- Ready byte.

### Interrupt Controller

The interrupt control gets the interrupt status from the 1-Wire Host Core Controller and generates an interrupt to the external processor.

The GPIO module implements a 3-state buffer to bypass the 1-Wire Host Core Controller and to manipulate the 1-Wire bus through GPIO.

## Programming Sequence

The following steps are helpful in accessing the AXI 1-Wire Host.

### Using the 1-Wire Host Core Controller

 1. Reset the core (write `0x8000_0000` to register, `w1_CTRL`).
 2. Enable the Ready interrupt mask (write `0x0000_0010` to register w1_IRQCTRL).
 3. Wait for the interrupt to be raised, and read the `w1_STA`T register to ensure the Ready signal raised the interrupt.
 4. Clear the interrupt mask (write `0x0000_0000` to register w1_IRQCTRL).
 5. Write instruction (write `0x0000_0*zyy*` to `w1_INSTR`, *z* is the instruction and *yy* the data to be transmitted if applicable. E.g., to transmit byte 0110_1010, instruction will be 0x0000_0F6A).
 6. Signal Go and clear the reset (write `0x0000_0001` to `w1_CTRL`).
 7. Enable the Done interrupt mask (write `0x0000_0001` to register w1_IRQCTRL).
 8. Wait for the interrupt to be raised and read the `w1_STAT` register to ensure the Done signal raised the interrupt.
 9. Clear the interrupt mask (write `0x0000_0000` to register, `w1_IRQCTRL`).
 10. Read the data register (`w1_RXDATA`) to fetch the received bits, if applicable.
 11. Clear the Go signal (write `0x0000_0000` to `w1_CTRL`).
 12. Return to step 2.

Steps 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 suppose the usage of the interrupt. If the interrupt is not used, steps 2, 3, and 4 can be replaced by a loop that reads the Ready value in the `w1_STAT` to be 1 and by replacing steps 7, 8, and 9 with a loop that reads the Done value in the `w1_STAT` to be 1.

### Using the GPIO

For reading the 1-Wire bus level:

 1. Configure the AXI 1-Wire Host for a GPIO read (write 0x8080_0000 to w1_INSTR).
 2. Read the `w1_GPIODATA` register.

For writing to the 1-Wire bus:

 1. Configure the AXI 1-Wire Host for a GPIO write (write `0x808*y*_0000` to `w1_INSTR`, replace *y* with 0 to write 0, 1 to write 1).

## Drivers

### Linux Drivers

The upstreamed **AXI 1-wire host driver for AMD programmable logic IP core** Linux driver can be used with a Linux system to interface with the AXI 1-Wire host.

### Baremetal Drivers

Rudimentary baremetal drivers are provided with the AXI 1-Wire Host to develop applications using AMD Vitis&trade;. The driver does not implement an interrupt; you are encouragekd to implement your own version of the baremetal driver to make use of the interrupt. To include the provided baremetal drivers, include the *axi_1wire_host.h* file. The provided driver functions are listed follows.

```

## Example Design Flow

This section describes the process of creating a design targeting the AMD Kria&trade; KD240 Drives Starter Kit. It includes customizing and generating the AXI 1-Wire Host, constraining the core, the synthesis and implementation steps to generate the hardware design, and the software integration.

This design flow requires the AMD Vivado™ and Vitis Unified Software Platform development tools. It has been tested with the 2023.1 and 2023.2 tools release.

### Customizing and Generating the AXI 1-Wire Host

This section includes information about using the Vivado Design Suite IP Integrator to generate a block design and to customize and generate the AXI 1-Wire Host. For more information on how to create an hardware design using the IP Integrator, refer to the *Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing IP Subsystems Using IP Integrator* [(UG994)](https://docs.amd.com/access/sources/dita/map?isLatest=true&url=ug994-vivado-ip-subsystems&ft:locale=en-US). The following steps describe the process of creating a complete hardware design for the Kria KD240 Drives Starter Kit; the same process with some adjustments, can be use to target another device.

1. Create a new Vivado project targeting the Kria KD240 Drives Starter Kit with the companion cards.
2. Create a Block Design.
3. In the new Block Design, add the AMD Zynq™ UltraScale+™ MPSoC IP and *Run Block Automation* to apply Board Preset.
4. Add the AXI 1-Wire Bus Host to the block design and *Run Connection Automation* with the default settings. This will add a Processor System Reset and an AXI Interconnect blocks. It will also connect the clocks to the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC `pl_clk0` 100 MHz clock and all the reset ports and the AXI interfaces.
5. *Run Connection Automation* a second time with the default settings to connect the second AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC AXI interface.
6. Connect the AXI 1-Wire Bus Host w1_irq port to the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC pl_ps_irq0[0:0] port.
7. Right-click the AXI 1-Wire Bus Host w1_bus port and click **Make External**. The final block design should look similar to the following.
![Block Diagram](./images/block_design.png)
8. If you double-click the AXI 1-Wire Bus Host, you will see the customization GUI; as you can see, the S00 AXI CLK DIVIDER has a value of 100 by default. If you are not using a 100 MHz clock for the `s00_axi_aclk` input of the AXI 1-Wire Bus Host, you will need to adjust this value accordingly.
![Customization GUI](./images/customization_gui.png)
9. You can now Validate the block design; there should not be any errors. If you have a look under the Address Editor tab, you will see the Base Address for the /axi_1wire_host_0/S00_AXI interface; it will probably be 0xA000_0000, but it might be different if there are other AXI blocks in the design.
10. Under *Sources*, select the *Hierarchy* tab. Expand the *Design Sources* folder, right-click the block diagram, and select **Create HDL Wrapper**. Select **Let Vivado manage wrapper and auto-update**, and click **OK**.
11. Create a new constraints source file, and add the following content. This will connect the w1_bus port to the KD240 1-Wire port and set the appropriate voltage and pull up resistor.

	```
	set_property PACKAGE_PIN H13 [get_ports w1_bus_0]
	set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports w1_bus_0]
	set_property PULLUP true [get_ports w1_bus_0]
	```

12. You can now generate the bitstream and export the Hardware Platform (File&rarr;Export&rarr;Export Hardware). Make sure to include the bitstream, this will generate a XSA file.

### Generating the Standalone Software Platform

This section includes information about using the Vitis Unified Software Platform to create the platform to run an application targeting the AXI 1-Wire Host. For more information on how to create a platform and an application, refer to the *Vitis Unified Software Platform Documentation: Application Acceleration Development* [(UG1393)](https://docs.amd.com/access/sources/dita/map?isLatest=true&url=ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration&ft:locale=en-US).

1. Create a new blank Vitis Workspace.
2. Create an Application Project.
3. For the platform, create a new platform from hardware (XSA) with the XSA previously generated with Vivado.

   - Keep *Generate boot componenets* checked.
   - Select *psu_cortexa53_0* as the Target processor to create the first stage boot loader (FSBL).
   - For the Application, select the *psu_cortexa53_0* as the target processor.
   - For the Domain, select standalone as the Operating System and 64-bit for the Architecture.
   - Select the *Empty Application(C)* templates.
4. Your workspace should look similar to the one in the following image. The AXI 1-Wire Host standalone driver can be found under *\<platform>/hw/drivers/axi_1wire_host_v1_0/src/*. The driver files consist of a C header file (*axi_1wire_host.h*) and two C source files (*axi_1wire_host.c* and *axi_1wire_host_selftest.c*). You can open the files for more details.
![Vitis Workspace](./images/vitis_init.png)
5. You can now create your own application targeting the AXI 1-Wire Host by taking advantage of the provided driver functions:

   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_Reset
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_TouchBit
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_ReadByte
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_WriteByte
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_ResetBus
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_SelfTest
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_GPIO_Read
   - AXI_1WIRE_HOST_GPIO_Write
